# assignment

There is one file with the name books.csv. The CSV file contains the general information about the books, like book name, author, year of publication, etc. This code will develop two API endpoints, with following functionalities : 

```1st API will return number of rows requested from the books.csv file.```

```2nd API will give freedom to the user to filter and see any data from the file. The user could only able to filter from the given column list. If a column is not present then a graceful error message should return. Even if the API didnâ€™t find any filter response then the user should get a empty response.```
